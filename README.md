# TwitchBot
A simple Twitch chat bot. Written in C#

Contains KatBot with a modular command interface and AkinatorBot a wrapper around the popular website.

I'm trying to make this fun and expand it quickly by adding a new feature per night.  Add feature suggestions as Issues https://github.com/exmello/TwitchBot/issues or submit Pull requests if you're daring.  I could use help writing tests and refactoring this into something larger.
